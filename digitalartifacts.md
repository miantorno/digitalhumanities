### Annotation
Jennifer Olive investigates the emergence of indie games that explore serious subjects - often referred to as “empathy games” - and proposes a methodology for studying the representation of trauma in videogames. Olive poses that there is a gap in Digital Humanities scholarship: an absence of frameworks of which to study the intersections of videogames and trauma studies. She identifies a need for structures that enable investigation into how players can take on complicit roles and witness roles in empathy games.

Olive establishes our understanding of trauma through the words of Caruth and LaCapra, and then expands that understanding to digital media through ideas presented in Janet Murray’s Hamlet on the Holodeck. She then invokes Ian Bogost’s idea of procedural rhetoric and Dori Laub’s Truth as Testimony: The Process and the Struggle to create a methodology focused around a remediated experience of witnessing - highlighting both the mediation of trauma through videogames as well as the medium’s representational potential.
